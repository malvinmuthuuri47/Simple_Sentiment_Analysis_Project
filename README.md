## A Simple Sentiment Analysis Project

## Description
The need to analyze sentiments for companies based on user feedback helps them to determine how users feel about their services which in turn can help in gaining a competitive advantage in the market. 

This project intends to help organizations do so by including a sentiment analyzer for every product in the organization's website. User feedback is analyzed and used to gauge metrics such as user satisfaction and contentment.

## Installation

After Installing Python, follow this [guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) to install the following project packages:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. flask <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. flask_bootstrap <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. textblob <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. time <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. collections <br>

These pacakges contain the project dependencies that the program needs for it to run as intended. After following these steps, you are now ready to see the beauty of NLP(Narutal Language Processing) and sentiment analysis.
